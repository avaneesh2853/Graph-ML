# Graph-ML
So far we have worked on using pytorch, making a CNN and implementing one on the MNIST Dataset. We have also learnt about graphs and word embedding methods, Network X, PyG, GNNs, GCNs, and GATs. This week, we will work on colab notebooks given by the mentor to understand NetworkX, PyG and various other stuff related to graph ML.
